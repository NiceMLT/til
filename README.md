# Today I learned

## A running log of what I learned today without ego or hubris.

**2/15/2019** - How the payment method selector table uses React to create micro-components that come together.  Really interesting way of making things extensible.

**2/18/2019** - How to create a feature test including filling in form fields (dont forget to JS: true or you'll be sad)

**2/18/2019** - Prepending feature tests with HEADLESS=0 allows me to see the clickthrough of the spec!

**2/19/2019** - Gotta remember to run linter. It's not terrible.

**2/20/2019** - In React you just props || 'default' to make sure the default is clickable

**2/21/2019** - You can pass named scopes down to other scopes. And specifically overwrite them in the downstream scope so you can encapsulate more diverse sets of data.

**2/25/2019** - Instead of newing up an empty collection and iterating over it, select members that pass the koalifcations.  Apparently I did not learn anything last Friday.
