#### Today I learned

## A running log of what I learned today without ego or hubris.

2/15/2019 - How the payment method selector table uses React to create micro-components that come together.  Really interesting way of making things extensible.
2/16/2019 - How to create a feature test including filling in form fields (dont forget to JS: true or you'll be sad)
