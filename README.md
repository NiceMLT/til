# Today I learned

## A running log of what I learned today without ego or hubris.

**2/15/2019** - How the payment method selector table uses React to create micro-components that come together.  Really interesting way of making things extensible.

**2/18/2019** - How to create a feature test including filling in form fields (dont forget to JS: true or you'll be sad)

**2/18/2019** - Prepending feature tests with HEADLESS=0 allows me to see the clickthrough of the spec!

**2/19/2019** - Gotta remember to run linter. It's not terrible.

**2/20/2019** - In React you just props || 'default' to make sure the default is clickable

**2/21/2019** - You can pass named scopes down to other scopes. And specifically overwrite them in the downstream scope so you can encapsulate more diverse sets of data.

**2/25/2019** - Instead of newing up an empty collection and iterating over it, select members that pass the koalifcations.  Apparently I did not learn anything last Friday.

**2/26/2019** - Jumped in to Sumo-Logic for the first time.  Got some good background in their query structure (it's more intuitive than I realized, just keep it simple to start and build from that.)

**2/28/2019** -  "Breaking a task down into consumable bits is an art" -- Remind yourself of this and take your time planning.  It might not simplify it for you, but it will simplify it for whomever reviews for you.

**3/7/2019** -  A litle more meta today: 21 days to make a habit.  I reminded Walden of that this morning.  I made it 2 weeks and forgot.  Don't beat yourself up but do hold yourself accountable.  

**3/11/2019** - You can nest PropTypes.  This is nifty `PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.oneOfType([`.

**3/12/2019** - A group of hedgehogs is called an array, which means that everything in an array is a hedgehog.  This is amazing.
