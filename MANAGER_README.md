## What is this?
This is a readme file that will help you better understand me and how I prefer to manage.
I'd rather be upfront and intentional about who I am and why I am the way that I am to help inform my teams about what they can expect and how we can better work together.

## About me
I'm a coach by nature. I spent 15 years of my adult life creating, organizing, and coaching an Ultimate Frisbee program for the local High School.
I coach travel baseball on nights and weekends and even before my time as a coach I gravitated towards playing team sports over individual sports.  
I relish team victories more than my own personal victories and as such gravitate towards teams where I can help eliminate obstacles and foster better communication in order to let the members on the team do what they do best.  
I believe strongly in open and honest conversations. My personal/professional growth has only happened as a direct result of me (and my managers) being open and honest with me.
One of my personal tenets is to never lie to people.  Lies require mental upkeep and tracking whereas the truth does not.  I do my best to be as honest as I can with the people on teams with me.
In that vein of open/honesty, I ask that people on my team evaluate themselves: where are they? where do they want to go? what's getting in their way?  I aim to help them on that path but ultimately it's their own path and I can't force anyone to walk down it. I encourage my teammates to keep a brag doc: https://dev.to/shikhar_sachdev/keep-a-brag-document-387f

Since I believe in being honest and open, I tend to assume the people on teams with me know that they are doing a good job inherently without constant praise.  That's a fault of my part that I am working on.  But if you're not getting feedback, it's likely it's because I believe you are doing a great job and I want you to keep chugging along.  But again, I'm working on being better at reminding folks of their successes.

I can't say that I value openness and honesty and then not be okay with you being those things with me.  I'll assume I'm meeting your needs unless you tell me otherwise. Being an EM is only a small part of my identity so telling me I could improve in some area isn't going to crush my spirit. I'll do my best to honor your feedback if possible.

I have a host of sayings I use regulalry that can inform you on how I think about the world:
- There's no feeling like being prepared (and the inverse is true as well)
- I can only solve problems I know about
- You are what you allow (or tolerate)
- Argue for your limitations and sure enough, they're yours (credit Richard Bach)


## 1:1s
They are your time to chat about whatever you like. Want to ask big questions about the company's direction? Sure! Want to ask about an upcoming feature? Sure! Want to talk baseball? I'm down!  I do like to avoid getting highly technical about tickets/approaches as I believe there's better time (standups, one off meetings with more people, etc) for those technical questions. If I do need to gather status of a particular project or ticket I'll try to get that first and then leave the rest of the time for your questions/concerns.  If I have specific feedback or guidance, I'll provide it as well but if I'm not providing that feedback it is safe to assume you are doing well. Please come prepared with questions or at least a general idea of what you want to get out of it. Better yet, create a developmental plan for what you want to accomplish within the next year, and letâ€™s use that as a framework. I generally prefer to schedule 1:1s Tu/Wed/Thurs during mid-day and have them at least every 2 weeks.  That way we don't ever go too long without chatting and we've insulated the timing of them from half days and long weekends. I tend to try to not schedule anything immediately after my 1:1s to ensure it's okay if they go long.  Some days we'll need 17 minutes, some days we'll need an hour.  That's perfectly fine!

## Pop-up calls/meetings
I know very well the feeling of a manager asking for a "quick chat" without context and fearing the worst. In an industry full of people who (incorrectly) feel like they don't belong there's not much worse than the feeling of "oh no, I've done something wrong" when the reality is the manager just had a question or wanted to fill you in on an important detail.  I strive to never have the "quick chat" without providing context and if I fail to provide it; you are welcome to always ask "about what?" and I'll let you know.  

## Group Meetings / Standups
I like a little banter to start the day. Tell the team about the awesome food you made or the car you fixed or the result of your sporting activities. I love the #remote-lyfe but admit it makes being connected to one another a little more challenging. I'll normally give a few minutes for banter and gently chide us if it fell short on a particular day. From there I like to spin quickly around the work at hand to get quick status and then circle back to any blockers. If you know you have a question for the group just let us know and we'll have you go last to stay "in context" as much as possible. If we need to dig a little deeper, we can either stay on the call with relevant parties or schedule something for a little later that same day.

## Work/Life Boundaries
I believe *FIRMLY* in work life balance. I coach travel baseball and have a daughter with dance lessons regularly. I expect that the end of my day is the end of my day and I encourage my team members to do the same. I understand that there are rare occasions where we need to hot-fix something urgently or push through a hard deadline (although I try to insulate my teams from hard deadlines when I can. A former manager of mine used to say "the work is going to take however long it is going to take" and I ascribe to that belief). I ask you to take your PTO regularly and turn off slack at night.  Relatedly:

## Communication
Slack is an asynchronous tool. Going both ways there's no requirement of immediate response for a question asked in slack. Perhaps the question needs investigation or further thought or maybe there's just a sandwich to be eaten. It's okay for a question to hang around for a bit (think a couple hours). If it requires more urgent response, hit it with a "bump" or ask for a call (with context). We won't begrudge either approach.

## PR Review / Team Participation
One of my favorite managers used to say "Always Assume Best Intentions" - it was his way of reminding us that we are on a team. If we start by assuming that people are generally trying their best then we can be more open to the feedback. I prefer suggestions over dogmatic "this is bad" and conversation over enforcement. We should strive to get quality code out as frequently as possible but we have to remember that there are a lot of ways to achieve the same outcome. If you disagree with an approach, back it up.

This document is a living document and subject to change. As I grow hopefully this document will grow.
